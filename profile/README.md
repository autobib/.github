## Autobib

Autobib is a command-line tool for managing bibliographic records. Check out the [autobib repository](https://github.com/autobib/autobib) for more information!

We mostly use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). We also develop some libraries to support Autobib:

- [`serde_bibtex`](https://github.com/autobib/serde_bibtex): A [serde](https://serde.rs/)-compatible bibtex (de)serializer.
- [`nucleo-picker`](https://github.com/autobib/nucleo-picker): A fuzzy picker tui library based on [nucleo](https://docs.rs/nucleo/latest/nucleo/).
- [`rsxiv`](https://github.com/autobib/rsxiv): An interface library for the [arXiv API](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual.html).

Mainly developed by (in alphabetical order):
